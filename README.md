# Horiseon-Refactor
UCF Bootcamp: Horiseon-Refactor project

This project is a refactor of the HTML / CSS code behind the Horiseon Marketing home page.  
Some changes were made to the HTML code (div's replaced with sections - alt "" descriptions added to .img links).  More significant changes were made to the CSS code.
CSS changes were made to consolidate code and increase eficiency.
The URL for the deployed page is: https://pmeighen.github.io/Horiseon-Refactor/
Here is a screen shot of the page:
